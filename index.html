        This is the Hangman game. The goal of the player is to guess letters
        until you ether guess the hidden word or run out of guesses. The theme 
        will be mario bros.

        There would be a big header at the top,
            "Mario Hangman"
         Sub header
            "press any key to get started",
        Different components of the game
            Wins - the amount of times you guess the word correctly in time.
            The Current Word - it would be just the "-------" indicating the hidden word.
                New random word mario themed picked every game from a array.
                Every time you get a correct guessed letter with a key up it replaces the 
                appropriate dash spot on the screen. 
                Once you guess all of them you win!
            Letters already guessed - the letters you already choosen.
                Display the list for user to see.
                Can't repeatly hit the same letter.
                Must be a lette.
            Number of guesses remaining.
                You start with 10 guesses, deincrement every incorrect letter.
                Run out of guesses you lose, starts a new game, picks new word.
            Sound or music - mario bros game sound effects for doing things,
                a coin noise for each successful guess.
                A super mario bros 1 board finish song with win,
                    potentialy fire works too.
